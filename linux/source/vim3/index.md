After connecting a 5V/2A power source to the USB-C port, your SBC will boot up. You will see the Khadas Logo appear on your display, and the white LED will flash in a regular pattern.

## Repeated & Unplanned Reboots
If your SBC repeatedly restarts, or restarts randomly, this is an indication of insufficient or unstable USB-C input power. Change your USB-C power cable and/or use a different power adapter.
